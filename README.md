# Reimbursement Management System

## Project Description

The Tuition Reimbursement System, TRMS, allows users to submit reimbursements for courses and training. The submitted reimbursement must be approved by that employee's supervisor, department head, and benefits coordinator. The benefits coordinator then reviews the grade received before finalizing the reimbursement.

## Technologies Used

* Flask - Python Server
* PostgresSQL
* VanillaJS - Webpage

## Features

* Users can search for a specific reimbursement by id
* Custom CSS is used for the webpage
* Managers can create new Users

Afterward just run the application from main.py and the server should be up.
